# **FastLearn: Mastering FastAPI & Webhooks**

Welcome to **FastLearn**! üöÄ

In this course, you will learn how to:
- Build a simple **FastAPI** app from scratch.
- Deploy it to **Vercel** for public access.
- Set up **Discord Webhooks** to send real-time notifications.
- Create an interactive **Streamlit app** to call the FastAPI API and display the results.

This course is perfect for those who want to dive into building modern APIs, deploying them with ease, and integrating real-time notifications. Whether you're a beginner or just looking for a quick refresher, this guide has everything you need to get started!

## ‚ú® **Introduction**

**FastLearn** is an easy-to-follow course that guides you through building a **FastAPI** app, deploying it on **Vercel**, integrating **Discord Webhooks**, and creating a **Streamlit** app to interact with it. In this course, you will get hands-on experience with **APIs**, **cloud deployment**, and **real-time notifications**, all while keeping things simple and straightforward.

By the end of the course, you‚Äôll have a fully functional FastAPI app running on Vercel, sending Discord notifications, and an interactive frontend using Streamlit.

## üöÄ **Prerequisites**

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

1. **Python** (v3.7 or above)
2. **Git** (for version control)
3. **Streamlit** (for the frontend)
4. **Vercel Account** (for deploying the FastAPI app)
5. **Discord Account** (to set up webhooks)
6. **Basic knowledge of Python**, APIs, and web development.

> **Tip**: If you're new to FastAPI or Streamlit, no worries! We‚Äôll guide you through everything you need to know in simple steps.

## üõ† **Steps Overview**

### **Step 1: Build Your FastAPI App**
You‚Äôll start by creating a simple FastAPI app with two endpoints:
- A `GET /` endpoint that returns a welcome message.
- A `POST /items/` endpoint that allows creating new items.

### **Step 2: Deploy to Vercel**
We‚Äôll take the FastAPI app and deploy it on **Vercel** with just a few commands. Vercel makes it super easy to deploy Python apps with minimal setup.

### **Step 3: Set Up Discord Webhooks**
Learn how to set up **Discord Webhooks** and integrate them into your FastAPI app. This will allow you to send notifications to a Discord channel whenever a new item is created.

### **Step 4: Build the Streamlit App**
Now, we‚Äôll create an interactive **Streamlit** app that communicates with the FastAPI app. The Streamlit app will allow users to create items and view real-time notifications sent to Discord.

### **Step 5: Call the API**
Finally, we‚Äôll set up a button in the Streamlit app to make a **GET request** to the deployed FastAPI API and display the response.
